# Seattle_AirBnB_Analysis

## Motivation
This is an attempt to understand what impacts the reviews of a listing. 
In other words, what features in a listing determines a high rating 
and what can Airbnb listers do to improve them. The following four questions was
an attempt in doing so:

> 1. Are there any significant correlations in the data?
> 2. Can we predict the review score?
> 3. What features impact the review rating?
> 4. What are the customers saying about high/low rating listings and is there any
insight to what impacted review scores.
